# Next.js + Jest

This example shows how to configure Jest to work with Next.js.

This includes Next.js' built-in support for Global CSS, CSS Modules and TypeScript. This example also shows how to use Jest with the App Router and React Server Components.

> **Note:** Since tests can be co-located alongside other files inside the App Router, we have placed those tests in `app/` to demonstrate this behavior (which is different than `pages/`). You can still place all tests in `__tests__` if you prefer.

## Deploy your own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest&project-name=with-jest&repository-name=with-jest)

## How to Use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-jest with-jest-app
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

```bash
yarn test
```

```bash
pnpm test
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
